# Phase I Testing Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: To prove that the robot can be reliably controlled in an urban setting with people and obstacles

**Participants**: Andrew, Frank, James, Sean

**Location**: Intersection of Rosedale Rd. and Park Rd.

## Objectives
### 1. Observe people's behavior and attitude towards the robot
* How do people react when in proximity of the robot?
* What is the attitude of bystanders towards a moving robot? (hostile? curious? friendly?)
* Do people make way for the robot?
* Robot visibility and reactions while driving around in darker settings

### 2. Control with both camera types (wide angle distorted and undistorted)
* Which camera provides a better sense of speed and depth?
* Is there sufficient peripheral vision while driving with the non-wide angle camera?
* How does the latency feel for either camera?
* Which camera provides better visual information in darker settings?
* Does the camera get blinded by the sun / reflections? Is there lens flare in very bright settings?
* Is the robot controllable at max speed?

### 3. Crossing roads with remote control
* What is the protocol for road-crossing preparation?
* Do the camera provide sufficient angle to look at the road? Or does the robot need to physically turn to "look left and right"?
* Does the robot have sufficient speed to make the crossing in a reasonable amount of time? How long does a crossing on an average street take?
* From "dropping in" on the robot at the controls to understanding the situation and completing a road crossing, how long does the whole process take?


### 4. Obtain more promotional footage of the robot in action
* Film the robot crossing the road
* Film the robot crossing a small road without the leash
* Photos of the cargo box interior (we should try to get a pizza and fit it into the box)
* Photos of the robot with a backdrop of random street people


#### 5. Obtain data on the robot's operation parameters
* How hot does the control box interior get?
* How long does a full charge of the battery last?
* How hot does the interior of the cargo box get?
* How well does the robot handle small curbs and bumps on the road?
* Are there any potential road configurations that will make the robot stuck?
* Acceleration figures and braking distance figures.
